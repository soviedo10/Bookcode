1. The data set chosen is Electric consumption per person according to the year and the country
2. The topic is the difference in electric consumption in the different countries during the decades
3.  I am most interested in searching the relationship that exists between developed countries and developing countries.  The different variables would be  years, country, and a made categorization which would be developed/ developing country
4.  The second topic would be the electric consumption per person during years on crisis according to the variable developed/developing
5. What are the differences in electric consumption per person in the years between developed and developing countries?
6. Hypothesis: The electric consumption per person in developing and developed countries is influenced by economic factors and energy crisis. Specifically, it is hypothesized that during periods of economic crisis and high energy prices, there will be a decrease in electric consumption per person in both developing and developed countries. However, the impact may be more severe in developing countries due to their higher vulnerability to energy poverty and limited access to affordable energy sources.
