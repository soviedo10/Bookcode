1. The data set chosen is Electric consumption per person according to the year and the country
2. The topic is the difference in electric consumption in the different countries during the decades
3.  I am most interested in searching the relationship that exists between developed countries and developing countries.  The different variables would be  years, country, and a made categorization which would be developed/ developing country
4.  The second topic would be the electric consumption per person during years on crisis according to the variable developed/developing
5. What are the differences in electric consumption per person in the years between developed and developing countries?
6. Hypothesis: The electric consumption per person in developing and developed countries is influenced by economic factors and energy crisis. Specifically, it is hypothesized that during periods of economic crisis and high energy prices, there will be a decrease in electric consumption per person in both developing and developed countries. However, the impact may be more severe in developing countries due to their higher vulnerability to energy poverty and limited access to affordable energy sources.
7. "Assessing the impact of the economic crisis on energy poverty in Greece" by A. Dagoumas and F. Kitsios: This study focuses on the impact of the economic crisis on energy poverty in Greece. While the specific findings may not directly address electric consumption per person, it provides insights into the relationship between economic crises and energy-related issues.

"Burden of the global energy price crisis on households" by Y. Guan, J. Yan, Y. Shan, Y. Zhou, Y. Hang, R. Li, Y. Liu, et al. (published in Nature Energy): This research examines the burden faced by households due to the global energy price crisis. While the focus may not be specifically on electric consumption per person, it offers insights into the overall impact of energy price fluctuations on individuals and households.

"Population of the world and regions as the principal energy consumer" by V. Lizunkov: This study explores the relationship between the world population and energy consumption. It may provide a broader perspective on energy consumption trends but may not specifically address electric consumption per person.

"The relationship between energy consumption, energy prices, and economic growth: time series evidence from Asian developing countries" by J. Asafu-Adjaye: This research investigates the relationship between energy consumption, energy prices, and economic growth in Asian developing countries. It may offer insights into the factors influencing energy consumption but may not focus exclusively on electric consumption.

"Financial crisis, energy, and sustainability in Brazil" by O. Lucon and J. Goldemberg: This study examines the impact of the financial crisis on energy and sustainability in Brazil. While it may not directly discuss electric consumption per person, it provides insights into the broader energy and economic context.

"Dilemma of third world countries-problems facing Pakistan energy crisis, a case-in-point" by M.T. Masood and F. Shah: This research focuses on the energy crisis in Pakistan and the challenges faced by third-world countries. While it may not specifically address electric consumption per person, it may offer insights into energy-related issues and their impacts.

These studies provide valuable information on energy-related topics and their relationship to economic factors, energy crises, and sustainability. However, it is important to conduct a more comprehensive literature review to explore studies specifically focused on electric consumption per person in developing and developed countries during different decades.
